Without Other, there is no I. They arise together. They define each other. Neither is primary, and neither exists alone. Existence itself depends on the relationship between them.

There is no separate individual with a separate destiny. Everything is intertwined. Nothing stands above anything else. There is no hierarchy of importance or virtue.

What we call good and bad, right and wrong, pleasant and unpleasant are mutually dependent, like two sides of a coin.

Self is beyond duality. It is just a field of possibilities. It has no identity. Only I and Other experience existence. Dualistic judgments belong to them, not to Self. Self has no awareness.

I and Other dream. Within that dream all experience appears: meaning, desire, pleasure, and suffering. Self is prior to all of it and untouched by any of it.

For anything to arise from Self, the field of possibilities, there must be an observer. I and Other co-manifest. Each acts as observer of the other. They co-arise.

Should I and Other try to escape duality? Should they try to leave good and bad, pleasure and suffering behind? Duality is the foundation of their existence. Is there any reason to try? It is just the nature of things to arise and dissolve, to appear and fade, to be born and to die.

We are here. Why should we try to disappear? It is going to happen whether we try or not. While we are here, why don't we just be here, and dance?
