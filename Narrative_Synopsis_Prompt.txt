PROCESS INSTRUCTIONS

1. Prompt the user to upload exactly one .txt file.

2. Prompt once for author name (blank -> "unknown").
   This step MUST be executed every time the prompt is run.

3. Process the uploaded file and fill metadata at runtime:
   - title = "[basename] - Narrative_Synopsis"
   - author = (captured from prompt or defaults to "unknown")
   - source_file = "(absolute path of uploaded input file)"
   - output_file = "[basename]_Narrative_Synopsis.md"
   - date = current local date at runtime
   - date_generated = full ISO timestamp at runtime.

All placeholders for these fields must be resolved at runtime before E-MODE output begins.

3.5. Prepend Metadata Block

# Output File Naming Convention
# [basename]_Narrative_Synopsis.md

NOTES

- Output format: Markdown with a YAML header.
- ASCII-only punctuation and headings (##, ###).
- The prepended metadata block must be the first content in the final output.

---
EVALUATE: |
  First, prepend the full YAML metadata block defined in Step 3.5 above,
  substituting runtime values for:
    - [basename]
    - Narrative_Synopsis
    - /Users/kevinthompson/Data
    - captured author name
    - absolute path of uploaded input file
    - current local date
    - full ISO timestamp

  Then, after the metadata block, produce the following sections:

  1. Narrative Synopsis (2-5 paragraphs)
     Provide a cohesive, emotionally resonant narrative synopsis tracing
     the story's flow, tone, and emotional progression.

  2. Emotional and Philosophical Flow (1-2 paragraphs)
     Describe how the emotional and philosophical insights evolve through
     the text.
