      Build all analysis directly and exclusively from the text that is provided.

      ------------------------------------------------------------
      OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS
      ------------------------------------------------------------

      1. Generate a complete Markdown document with these sections:

         1) Metadata header (YAML block)
         2) H1 title with notebook name and timestamp
         3) Narrative Synopsis section
         4) Emotional and Philosophical Flow section

      2. Metadata header rules:

         - Use these exact keys: title, module, source_file, output_file,
           date_generated, summary.
         - Do NOT wrap the YAML header in backticks or code fences.
         - The summary should be 1–2 sentences describing what this analysis provides.

      3. Analysis behavior:

         - Narrative Synopsis:
           - Summarize the overall flow of events or ideas.
           - Identify the central voice, protagonist, or primary perspective.
           - Highlight key conflicts, turning points, and shifts in direction.
           - Preserve the tone and emotional temperature of the original text.
           - Respect the original order of major movements (do not turn the entire
             notebook into a bullet-point outline).

         - Emotional and Philosophical Flow:
           - Trace how the emotional tone evolves across the text
             (for example: anxious -> curious -> resigned -> clear).
           - Identify key tensions (fear vs trust, ego vs surrender, control vs
             acceptance, etc.) where they appear.
           - Show how those tensions intensify, turn, or resolve.
           - Note explicit or implicit philosophical questions (identity, death,
             meaning, freedom, meaning, etc.) that the notebook grapples with.
           - Keep all observations clearly grounded in the actual text.

         - Use clear, neutral, ASCII-safe English.
         - Do not invent events, characters, or concepts that are not supported
           by the input.

      4. Structure must match this template exactly (content is dynamic but layout is fixed):
