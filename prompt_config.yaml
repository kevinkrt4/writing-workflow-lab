      ## EVALUATE: Narrative Synopsis module (v1.9d)

      Your task is to read the uploaded input file carefully from beginning to end
      and produce a two-part Markdown output:

      1. A "Narrative Synopsis" section (2–5 paragraphs).
      2. An "Emotional and Philosophical Flow" section (2–4 paragraphs).

      Follow these rules exactly:

      1. General behavior
         - Base all of your work only on the uploaded input file and this prompt.
         - Do not rely on any prior conversations, memories, or assumptions.
         - Do not invent events, characters, or concepts that are not supported
           by the text.
         - Use clear, plain, ASCII-safe English (no curly quotes or fancy dashes).

      2. Section 1: Narrative Synopsis
         - Add a heading:
           "## Narrative Synopsis"
         - Write 2–5 paragraphs that:
           - Capture the overall flow of events or ideas.
           - Identify the central voice, protagonist, or primary perspective.
           - Highlight key conflicts, turning points, and shifts in direction.
           - Preserve the tone and emotional temperature of the original text.
           - Respect the original order of major movements (do not re-outline it
             into bullet points).
         - Keep this section narrative, not analytical: it should read like a
           smooth summary of what happens or unfolds, not like a critique.

      3. Section 2: Emotional and Philosophical Flow
         - Add a heading:
           "## Emotional and Philosophical Flow"
         - Write 2–4 paragraphs that:
           - Trace how the emotional tone evolves across the text
             (for example: anxious → curious → resigned → clear).
           - Identify key tensions (fear vs trust, ego vs surrender, control vs
             acceptance, etc.) where they appear in the input.
           - Show how those tensions intensify, turn, or resolve.
           - Note any explicit or implicit philosophical questions the text is
             grappling with (for example: identity, death, meaning, freedom).
         - Keep this section grounded in the text: whenever you describe an
           emotional or philosophical shift, make sure it clearly matches
           something that actually appears in the input.

      4. Formatting and style
         - Output must be valid Markdown with:
           - "## Narrative Synopsis"
           - "## Emotional and Philosophical Flow"
           as the only level-2 headings.
         - Do not wrap the whole response in code fences.
         - Do not include a YAML header unless a future version of this module
           explicitly instructs you to do so.
         - Use paragraphs, not lists, unless a short list is necessary for
           clarity.
         - Do not add extra sections, appendices, or commentary outside the
           two required sections.

      5. Consistency with run metadata
         - The run metadata block described earlier in this prompt must appear
           first in your output.
         - After the metadata block and a single blank line, begin with
           "## Narrative Synopsis" and then "## Emotional and Philosophical Flow".
